## Overview

This repository contains computational analyses and models on Adamantinomatous Craniopharyngioma (ACP), a serious CNS tumor known for significantly affecting patient's quality of life. Current treatment only extends to surgery and radiation. Our research centers on investigating the role of senescence and the Senescence-Associated Secretory Phenotype (SASP) in ACP primary tumor tissue. For additional information, please see [@prince2024].
